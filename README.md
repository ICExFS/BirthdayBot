## What's that? 🍹
A Discord Bot which sets Birthday & Wish Birthday

## How to use it? 🏹
To run it, check the run file. 🥂

## What about the privacy 🍉
The bot's only taking the day, and the month. Not the year 🌊

## How to install packages? 📦
Clone the repository, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Warning 🟠
You should change some of the emojis in main.py, i've used them as a test in my server, but they will not work in your server since your bot isn't in my server ✔️
